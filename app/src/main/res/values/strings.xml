    <string name="READ_MORE">Hello guys and girls\n
        I\'ve developed this app for providing previous year question papers of your respected courses by which you can prepare for your semester exams quite well.\n
        I know not all the courses are available in this app but i\'ve tried my best to add courses but for some reasons i couldn\'t so get help from the papers which are available here.\n
        This app is not optimized yet because the resources used in this app are taken from github and are not stable so it will cause some crashes but can provide you the content you need.\n
        \!\!\!IMPORTANT\ !\!\!
        \nWhen the PDF load completely,Don\'t scroll too fast as it cause crash in the app so use efficiently.\n
        Thank You ;)
